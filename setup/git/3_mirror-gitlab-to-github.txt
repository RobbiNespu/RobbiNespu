Method with Fine-grained personal access token works!
====================================================
Then I found this link on how to Set up a push mirror from GitLab to GitHub that was linked in the official GitLab docs, but has different instructions (facepalm). 
So I followed that and if finally worked! 

The only downside is that the Fine-grained personal access tokens must have an expiration date (at the moment I could only set it max to a year). 

That means in a year, I will have to deal with this again. And I am sure I won't remember any of this happened :) For completeness, here are the steps:

    1. Create a new GitHub repo where you want to mirror your GitLab repo.
    2. Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens > Generate new token
    3. Restrict the token to apply only for your new repository and in Repository permissions, give it a read&write access on Contents.
    4. Generate the token and copy it.
    5. Go to GitLab repo > Settings > Repository > Mirroring repositories > Add new mirror
    6. Paste the full https url of your GitHub repo, e.g. https://github.com/user/repo
    7. Fill in your GitHub username and as a password, use the fine-grained token you copied earlier
    8. Click on Mirror repository
    9. Click on Update now
